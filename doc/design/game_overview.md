# Game Overview

Player is a predetermined mascot sprite. Possible feature expansion for a character select screen. The player races in one of nine themed ballparks with themed mascots for the park, along the warning track of the ballpack.  Each park will have a different set of obstacles to avoid, or no obstacles in the case of the starting track.  If you win a park, you continue to a new park.  If you lose, you are kicked back to the Park Select screen.  If you lose three times, it's game over and the game resets.
If you win in each park without losing three times, you win the game!

# Player Controls

Players use arrow keys or WASD to control their race, as well as spacebar to jump and shift for a temporary speed boost.  The speed boost is a 1.4x modifier with a 2s duration, that recharges in 10s.

# Park Select

Once you start, you are presented with a 3x3 matrix of parks to choose from.  There is no linear progression in the parks, but once you win them, a green border encircles the icon for the park.
